There are two types of memory.

1- Stack
2- Heap

a = 10;

Where " a " is called Refrence Variable   and  " 10 " is called object

1- Stack

Refrence Variable like " a " stores in Stack memory.

2- Heap

Object like " 10 " stores in Heap memory.

	
Note :  " a " variable store in Stack memory pointing out the Object " 10 " in Heap memory.


Garbage Value : When no refrence variable pointing out the object means an object store in memory but no refrence variable pointing out this object.

Then it is called Garbage Vale and it is automatically removed from the memory when the garbage value hits.
